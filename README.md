# Writing-Patterns-Observations
We analyze 730K+ arXiv papers using author-specific LaTeX macros to infer individual writing contributions. Validated against multiple benchmarks, our method reveals a division of labor: first authors write technical sections, last authors focus on conceptual onesâ€”offering new tools for fairer credit in team science.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is available on Zenodo: [Observational Author Contributions in arXiv Papers] (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15243518)
